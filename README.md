# Rice-Profitability-Analysis-using-Excel
Projection of rice profitability depending on money invested

# Introduction:
This is project offered to me by a client to help him create a visual of how much profit can be made when 20 million naira is invested into his business. He needed this to help convince investors to invest in his business.
Before uploading and posting of this on my portfolio, I have sought his permission and also remove all private information.
Enjoy :)
 
# Problem Statement:
The major goals of this project is to visualize to show:
1. The overall status of the business,
2. Cheapest farms to get rice from for processing,
3. How much profit can be gotten if 20 million naira is invested and bought from the cheapest location.

# Data Source:
The data used for this project was is a private data from the company and as such cannot be shared here. 
To protect the company's rights, I have anonymized the locations and take out the company's logo from the screenshot of the final project 

# Data Transformation:
The data went to various transformation including:
1. Data Entry/Importing: The data existed in several tables on Microsoft word and thus this data was first copied and entered into excel, then converted into a table.
2. Data Cleaning: The data was then imoorted into power query for cleaning as it was too large and would require difficult task cleaning this data individually. 
(a). Issues of missing rows were first solved by filling where necessary and where it wouldn't affect the result, the rows were removed.
(b). Some columns were splited to get relevant information
(c). Data types were also adjusted for the columns to fit the data they are representing accurately.
